            <p class="first-letter">This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About
                twelve
                o'clock a troop of ten
                or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried
                to
                clear the way with its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched
                along
                with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening
                bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing
                can
                moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most
                reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should
                please
                the buffaloes to get out of the way.</p>
            <p>Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of
                revolvers
                upon them.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they
                were
                not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his
                programme!
                And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"</p>
            <br>
            <p class="ending"><span class="quotation-mark">“&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The engineer did not try to
                overcome the
                obstacle,
                and he was
                wise. </p>
